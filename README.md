| Description   | Solution | Difficulty |
|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <b>FizzBuzz</b> - A program that outputs the string representation of numbers from 1 to n. But for multiples of three it should output “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five output “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five output “FizzBuzz”.  <br>  | [Look](https://github.com/midNight-jam/hyperLC/blob/master/python/FizzBuzz.py)                               |Easy|
| <b>Hamming Distance</b> - The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different. Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance. Input: x = 1, y = 4 Output: 2 number of positions where the corresponding bits are different.<br>  | [Look](https://github.com/midNight-jam/hyperLC/blob/master/python/HammingDistance.py)                               |Easy|
